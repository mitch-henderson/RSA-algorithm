    "\n",
    "### Then, also in the first toolset, I run another algorithm called Exapnded Euclidean Algorithm. This will be used to determine the value of \"d\". \"d\" is the inverse of e modulo (p-1)(q-1).  We keep these values d and n as our private key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The functions in the second toolset will generate the public and private key pairs which will then be used to create a ciphertext using the public key and then decode the same using the private key. So here in my second toolset, find_public_key, I have a function that will produce two values, e and n. This function will run a loop to find e such that e is relatively prime to (p - 1) (q - 1) and not equal to p or q.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Then, in our second toolset, find_private_key, we have a function to find the decryption exponent d such that d is the modular inverse of e.  This uses the Extended Eucliean Algorithm and returns d: the decryption component. \n",

    "### Then, in my third part, I use the Encode function Convert_Text from Second tool set and get a list of numbers. I encode each of those numbers using n and e and return the encoded cipher_text. Using the public key, the Encode function will encode a message and generate the corresponding cipher_text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Here, in my third part, we use the Decode function.  the cipher_text will be a list of integers. First, I decrypt each of those integers using n and d. I use the function that converts the integers to a string defined in second toolset to recover the original message as a string. Using the private key, the Decode function will decode a ciper_text and recover the original message.\n",
